# Intersectable Subway System
Have you tried to connect a subway track with a Road Builder road and found out you can't?
You planned an extensive network now it will all fail thanks to this annoyance?
Well, never fear, when I'm here.

This mod introduces a completely redone Subway system which can intersect with any roads (not tracks) thus making it compatible with Road Builder roads.

Includes tracks, stations, and subway yard (does not include any update, yet).

You can find all the items in a new tab in the Transportation menu right after the vanilla Subway system.

## Some pointers
* The intersections aren't created natively in the vanilla game.
* This means the subway rails are present even at the intersection by which the vehicles/citizens will phase through.
* There is no traffic control, vehicles/citizens stop right in front of the passing subway train.
* Visual glitches exist at intersections.

# DISCLAIMER
* Safe to remove. This mod will not break your save if removed.
* This mod may require ***Asset Packs Manager*** which is highly experimental. This mod shouldn't break the save game. But subscribing to assets that require this without the dependency will pop up errors. Worst case you'll get error popups on game load and/or grey boxes in save. But either way, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE for any damage. Contact me on Discord and I'll try to help you recover anyway.
